# human-activity-recognition-using-machine-learning
This project aims to identify the human activity with the help of the data collected through smartphones sensors. The 6 activities I have selected are: running, walking, sitting, laying, climbing upstairs, climbing downstairs. This project can be used by medical health care centres or hospitals etc for keeping a check or monitoring activities of patients.

Abstract:The main focus of our project is the recognition of human activities which can be effectively used for medical and human study. In this project, we will design a system which will recognize and classify various human activities such as sitting, standing, moving upstairs, moving downstairs, etc. We will use classification and recognition techniques such as KNN, Random forest, Neural Network and Logistic decision. The best technique will be chosen on the basis of the accuracy matrix. Our dataset has the readings of various sensors of the Android Smartphone such as accelerometer, Proximity Sensor, Heart Rate monitor, Fingerprint Scanner, Iris Scanner, etc. This project will recognize if the human is sitting, standing, lying down, climbing up stairs etc. on the basis of the readings of the sensors. 
 
Keywords: KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, classification, data pre-processing  


Introduction 
In today’s world, everybody has a Smartphone and it is the appropriate analyzer for any activity we do.  We can analyze human activity with the help of smartphones because it is already embedded with ample number of sensors which are required to examine the user activities. This will be useful for various medical organizations and also for human survey organizations as with this data, we can determine the user’s past activities for medical treatments. For example, in this project, by determining the physical activity of a diabetic person ,one can keep a check on their sugar levels. Our system will use the sensors of the Android Smartphone such as accelerometer, Proximity Sensor, Heart Rate monitor, Fingerprint Scanner, Iris Scanner, etc.  Our system will analyze the 6 activities: Climbing Upstairs, Downstairs, Walking, Standing, Sitting, Laying.
